        <tbody>My name is Max and I was born on the ddst of mmmmmmmm year yyyy in Sweden. As of August 2023 <br/>
        I am attending my fourth year of the technology programme at NTI Nacka, located in Nacka Strand. <br/>
        I have previously attended school at Klara SÃ¶dra where I attended the technology programme for three <br/>

          I have little experience of coding before the fourth year I'm currently attending, <br/>
          which consists of one year of coding in the course "programming 1", of which I remember little. <br/>
          At the time of writing this I have learned quite a fair amount of programming. I have worked with <br/>
          python for one assignment, then mostly react where I have been using a lot of javascript html and css. <br/>
          Outside of school I have also been working on learning more html css and javascript on my own, using <br/>
          youtube videos to learn.
